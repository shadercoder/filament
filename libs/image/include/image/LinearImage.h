 * LinearImage is a handle to packed floating point data, arranged into a row-major 2D grid.

 * We use this object as input/output for core algorithms that wish to be agnostic of source and
 * destination formats. The underlying pixel data has shared ownership semantics to allow clients to
 * easily pass around the image object without incurring a deep copy. The number of channels is
 * arbitrary (1 or more) but we often use 3-channel images to represent color data.
 *
 * By convention, we do not use channel major order (i.e. planar). However we provide a free
 * function in ImageOps to combine planar data. Pixels are stored such that the row stride is simply
 * width * channels * sizeof(float).
